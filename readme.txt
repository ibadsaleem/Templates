                                                         ===============
1. Create a c++ Program to add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers using class template. Two numbers can be of same datatype or combination of different data types.

2. Create a c++ Program to swap the data using template function, instead of calling a function by passing a value, use call by reference , Two numbers can be of same datatype or    combination of different data types.

3. Create a c++ class called mycontainer that can store one element of any type and that it has just one member function called increase, which increases its value. But we find      that when it stores an element of type char it would be more convenient to have a completely different implementation with a function member uppercase, declare a class template    specialization for that type

4. Create a class Inventory that contains item code, description, rate per unit and total units in stock.
    a) Create 5 objects of inventory.
    b) Create a menu based program to handle data file to store these five objects.
    c) Also add a function to edit the stock of any given item.
    d) Add a function that displays the details of the item whose code is passed as a parameter. e) Add an overloaded version of the function details () that print all the items          with their details.
5. Implement bubble sort algorithm using function template and show the results for the following arrays:
    1) 7, 5, 4, 3, 9, 8, 6       2) 4.3, 2.5, -0.9, 100.2, 3.0
